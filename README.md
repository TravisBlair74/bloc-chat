Bloc chat is a basic chatroom app that uses firebase and allows users to create and delete chatrooms, as well as create messages in those chat rooms tied to their username and with a timestamp.

# Technologies Used
* React
* Javascript

# Explanation
This was my final React project in the Bloc curriculum and was a great way to put all my knowledge to good use.  I enjoyed working with Firebase as well and it will be a good tool to know about in the future.
